# Maps + Animation 
## Client site with tons of animations and custom maps.

I've pulled a few files from this large site build to show off some fun animations + maps work I did. The site is now defunct, but it's still visible on the Wayback Machine. (Just be patient, as loading can be slow.)

### Here are some things to check out:

#### Why ___?

This is a fun "animated brochure" with the intention of attracting business to invest in this particular region. You can find the PHP in `__why-noco2.php` and the SCSS in `css/sass/partials/whynoco2.scss`

#### Home page

More parallax and some animations + a carousel. `__home.php` and `css/sass/partials/home.scss`

#### Communities

Hero area is a Google Maps API instance with pins pulled from WordPress data, and a custom image overlay. Most of the good stuff is in `community-map.php`
